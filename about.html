            <h2>About Roadception</h2>
            <p>Roadception is an innovative project focused on autonomous vehicle technology, specifically lane detection on Indian roads. With limited lane markings and varying road conditions, traditional lane detection methods often fall short. Our system uses advanced image processing techniques to identify road boundaries, lane positions, and assist vehicles in navigating without clear lane markings.</p>
            <p>The core goal of Roadception is to make self-driving cars more reliable and efficient in challenging environments. By leveraging machine learning and computer vision, we aim to improve the vehicle's ability to understand and navigate roads safely, even in regions with poorly marked lanes or no lane markings at all.</p>

            <h2>Project Highlights</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lane Detection:</strong> The project utilizes Canny edge detection and clustering techniques to identify road edges and lanes in real-time video feeds, even without lane markings.</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced Image Processing:</strong> Applying smoothing techniques and edge detection to ensure continuity of road features, making the system adaptable to different lighting and road conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Machine Learning Integration:</strong> The system uses a machine learning model to recognize road patterns and predict lane boundaries, ensuring accurate navigation in dynamic environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on Indian Roads:</strong> Roadception is specifically designed to address challenges in Indian road conditions, where lane markings are often missing or unclear, making traditional lane detection methods ineffective.</li>
